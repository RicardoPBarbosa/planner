# Introduction

#### ‚ÑπÔ∏è This is my 2nd iteration on the app. It started as a [Weekly Planner](https://github.com/RicardoPBarbosa/weekly-planner) only.

#### This is my personal planner that I use since 2019. I started by doing the design (heavily inspired by [this weekly planner](https://inkyinthewild.com/products/a4-weekly-planner-desk-pad-to-do-list-motivation-goal-setting-notepad-student-revision-agenda-office-notebook-organiser-with-health-tracker)) in Figma and printed it.

#### But now, after more than 100 pages printed, I see that it's not a scalable option, so I decided to make the web version of it. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

#### And decided to share it, in case it fits the needs of some other being out there in the vastness of space. üî≠

## Other features

## History üïí
Here you can see and edit the previous days/weeks/years. You can also create an entry in the past.

## Sync data to a cloud database ‚òÅÔ∏è
Link your google account, and sync the data to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

## PWA features
This is a PWA (Progressive Web App), which means that you can install it as an app, and use it offline. 

## Offline Capabilities
You can use it offline, and it will sync the new data when you're back online. As offline data goes you will have available the last synced data when you were online. All this is handled by [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/enable-offline).
